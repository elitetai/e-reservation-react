# e-Reservation

This react project is a simple e-reservation web app that could help the diner to book or reserve a table whilst the restaurant owner can allocate the tables based on the queue number:

1. Customer/diner shall input the headcount number and they will obtain the tables required and the amount of customers being allocated to a table automatically.
1. If there's no available table, it will automatically prompt the amount of customers that will have to wait for next available table and also they will get a queue number.
1. Restaurant owner can set the amount of tables with a fix amount of chairs per table.
1. The tables availability will be shown as a progress bar 
1. The owner can vacant the occupied tables once available.
1. The owner can also manually allocate the tables with given queue numbers.


**Additional info**
